# openstack-continuous-integration / ci_provisioner

The purpose of this repository is to provide the necessary Ansible code to provision a CI server. It can be used either with a Packer constructor to generate OpenStack images or a Terraform one to troubleshoot on a live system.

Go to the [ubuntu-24.04](https://github.com/openstack-continuous-integration/ubuntu-24.04) repository to see how to use it.
